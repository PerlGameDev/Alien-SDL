NAME
    Alien::SDL - building, finding and using SDL binaries

VERSION
    Version 0.8.0

SYNOPSIS
    Alien::SDL tries (in given order) during its installation:

    *   Locate an already installed SDL + related libraries (via
        'sdl-config')

    *   Check for SDL libs in directory specified by SDL_INST_DIR variable

    *   Download prebuilt SDL binaries (if available for your platform)

    *   Build SDL binaries from source codes (if possible on your system)

    Later you can use Alien::SDL in your module that needs to link agains
    SDL and/or related libraries like this:

        # Example of Makefile.pl
        use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
        use Alien::SDL;

        WriteMakefile(
          NAME         => 'Any::SDL::Module',
          VERSION_FROM => 'lib/Any/SDL/Module.pm',
          LIBS         => Alien::SDL->config('libs'),
          INC          => Alien::SDL->config('cflags'),
          # + additional params
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Please see Alien for the manifesto of the Alien namespace.

    In short "Alien::SDL" can be used to detect and get configuration
    settings from an installed SDL and related libraries. Based on your
    platform it offers the possibility to download and install prebuilt
    binaries or to build SDL & co. from source codes.

    The important facts:

    *   The module does not modify in any way the already existing SDL
        installation on your system.

    *   If you reinstall SDL libs on your system you do not need to
        reinstall Alien::SDL (providing that you use the same directory for
        the new installation).

    *   The prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources are always
        installed into perl module's 'share' directory.

    *   If you use prebuild binaries and/or binaries built from sources it
        happens that some of the dynamic libraries (*.so, *.dll) will not
        automaticly loadable as they will be stored somewhere under perl
        module's 'share' directory. To handle this scenario Alien::SDL
        offers some special functionality (see below).

METHODS
  sdl_config()
    This function is the only public interface to this module. Basic
    functionality works in a very similar maner to 'sdl-config' script:

        Alien::SDL->config('prefix');   # gives the same string as 'sdl-config --prefix'
        Alien::SDL->config('version');  # gives the same string as 'sdl-config --version'
        Alien::SDL->config('libs');     # gives the same string as 'sdl-config --libs'
        Alien::SDL->config('cflags');   # gives the same string as 'sdl-config --cflags'

    On top of that this function supports special parameters:

        Alien::SDL->config('shared_libs');

    Returns the list of full paths to shared libraries (*.so, *.dll) that
    will be required for running the resulting binaries you have linked with
    SDL libs.
