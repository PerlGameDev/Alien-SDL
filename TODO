TODO list for Perl module Alien::SDL

- discuss automated CPAN Testers issues (and perhaps change build defaults somehow)
- think of a complex t\alien_sdl_interface.t (we need this more in SDL_perl)
- move prebuilt binaries to http://sdl.perl.org/
- switch src builds to SDL_ttf-2.0.10.tar.gz (not released yet)
  unofficial version: http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-2.0.10.tar.gz
- give option to use old sources
- give app to update and manage source code see below
- use a json file which we can update off site (not hard coded) to link to new SHA sum and packs
